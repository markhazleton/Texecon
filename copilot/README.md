# Copilot Documentation Sessions

This directory contains session-based documentation generated by GitHub Copilot to help maintain and improve the TexEcon project.

## Directory Structure

Each session is organized by date in the format `session-YYYY-MM-DD/` and contains relevant documentation generated during that development session.

### Current Sessions

#### 2025-09-03

- Initial project optimization and dependency cleanup
- Build pipeline troubleshooting and fixes
- GitHub Copilot instructions setup

## Documentation Types

Each session may contain the following types of documentation:

### Technical Documentation

- `architecture-decisions.md` - Technology choices and technical decisions
- `api-integration.md` - API integration patterns and error handling
- `performance-analysis.md` - Bundle analysis and optimization reports
- `deployment-guide.md` - Deployment procedures and configurations

### Development Documentation

- `component-library.md` - UI component documentation and patterns
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `testing-strategy.md` - Testing approaches and guidelines
- `code-review-notes.md` - Code review feedback and improvements

### Project Management

- `session-summary.md` - Overview of work completed in each session
- `next-steps.md` - Planned improvements and future tasks
- `decisions-log.md` - Important project decisions and rationale

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Copilot-Generated Content**: All documentation in session folders should be generated or guided by GitHub Copilot
2. **Date-Based Organization**: Create new session folders for each development day
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Document decisions, patterns, and solutions for future reference
4. **Actionable Content**: Include specific examples, code snippets, and step-by-step instructions

## Integration with GitHub Copilot

This documentation structure is designed to work with the GitHub Copilot instructions located in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. The instructions guide Copilot to automatically place relevant documentation in the appropriate session folder.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include code examples and screenshots when relevant
- Document both successes and failures for learning
- Update existing documentation when patterns evolve
- Cross-reference related documentation across sessions
